Network
-------

Since we're doing some work on graphs, I thought it'll be fun to see the network. Hopefully, being able to visualize the graph will help in all the degree and centrality calculations that we're doing. This is a first pass at reimplementing the D3.js force directed graph to visualize character coappearance in Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables*.
